                <p>Aquaculture systems range from very extensive, through semi-intensive and highly intensive to hyper-intensive. When using this terminology the specific characterization of each system must be defined, as there are no clear distinctions and levels of intensification represent a continuum.

                    Farming systems are also diverse for example including:</p>

                <h1>SMALL AQUATIC</h1>
                <img src="C:\sdp project\52.jpg">
                <P>The use of rainwater storage ponds for aquaculture is another effective use of the resource. The aquaculture production is a bonus. In other small-scale systems the aquaculture component is the primary role, with water storage as an accessory feature (for garden irrigation and watering of livestock).
                    Integration of livestock and aquaculture is common in many countries although in the future, the use of livestock or industrial effluents (e.g. sewage, heated water, process water) for aquaculture may raise ethical issues (moral and public health), that will have to be addressed. Specific issues are those of disease transmission and accumulation of toxic compounds.</P>

                    <h1>FISHERY AQUATICCULTURE</h1>
                    <img src="C:\sdp project\53.jpg">
                    <P>The production of fish from cages is increasing globally. The technologies are now well developed in Europe, parts of South America (Chile in particular) and China. In SE Asia, cage farming of fish is advancing rapidly, in a wide range of species; the main limitations being the availability and high cost of feeds and shortage of seed. There is already considerable transboundary movement of fish seed and fingerlings in Asia, mainly for live fish markets in Hong Kong and China. Little is known of environmental impacts, although this trade is known to result in some destructive fishing techniques for fish fingerlings.</P>

                            <h1>RAS RECIRCULATION AQUATICCULTURE</h1>
                            <img src="C:\sdp project\55.jpg">
                            <P>The uses of recirculation vary widely, from broodstock management, hatchery and nursery rearing, grow-out and quarantine holding. It is likely that use of recirculation systems in intensified commercial aquaculture will increase in future. There are many possible solutions, adaptable to specific local situations.

                                The PAS system for American catfish is one example. It combines an extensive set of channels within the pond, for water treatment, with a highly intensive growth enclosure. The very slow circulation with low energy requirement provides good control of pond environmental processes whilst conserving water.</P>
