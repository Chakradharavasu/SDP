1)Nearly 80% of the 140 million farming families hold less than 2 acres of land. 
  
2)Large land holdings enable the farmer to implement modern agricultural techniques and boost productivity.

4)Most of the farmers – especially the poor and marginal ones – are dependent on seeds sold in the market. Moreover, the HYV seeds as well as the GM seeds which promise higher yields force the farmers to buy seeds for every crop.

5)In many cases of GM and HYV seeds, farmers are forced to use high amounts of fertilisers and pesticides, provide large amounts of water (irrigation) and abide to all the other farming requirements that the companies mandate to get the proper yields.
